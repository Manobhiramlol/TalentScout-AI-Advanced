cd TalentScout-AI-Advanced
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

Windows:
```powershell
python -m venv talentscout_env
talentscout_env\Scripts\activate
```

macOS / Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv talentscout_env
source talentscout_env/bin/activate
```

3. **Install required dependencies**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip

4. **Configure environment variables**  
Create a `.env` file in the project root. See `.env.example` for a template.

---

### 🏃 Running the Application

Option 1 — Streamlit only (recommended for quick start):
```bash
streamlit run main.py
# then open http://localhost:8501
```

Option 2 — Full stack (FastAPI + Streamlit):  
Terminal 1 — Start backend API:
```bash
uvicorn api.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
Terminal 2 — Start frontend:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Access points:
- Main app: http://localhost:8501  
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs  
- API health: http://localhost:8000/health

---

### 🔍 Verification & Troubleshooting
Check API health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
Common issues:
- Port already in use: change ports if 8501 or 8000 are occupied  
- API key issues: verify GROQ_API_KEY in `.env`  
- Dependencies missing: re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- Virtual environment inactive: ensure it's activated before running commands
